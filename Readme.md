# ODSC Meetup Dublin

Public Datasets and APIs with Johannes Ahlmann

## Getting Started

* create a new virtual environment using python 3.x
* install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* launch jupyter notebooks `jupyter-notebook`

## Credentials

In order to code along fully with this talk you will need to setup a couple of (easily created) credentials before the talk:

* Google Bigquery (free account)
* Twitter (free API key)
* Youtube (free API key)
* Geonames API/ username (easier to play around with ;)

Please check at the top of the respective notebooks how to setup those credentials.

## .env

Once you have the respective credentials, copy `sample.env` to `.env` and put your credentials in this file. The file is not tracked/ ignored by git.
